## The assignment

We'd like you to build a single page web app for viewing and editing fake profiles. This project should integrate your knowledge of backend APIs, JS, and HTML/CSS. We don't expect expertise in all three areas, but we'd like to see competency in all three, with a preference for strength in backend and business logic. Feel free to "spike" in whichever areas you feel strongest.

1. A user profile consists of up to six photos, up to three answers to some user-selected questions (from a pre-defined list), and some basic information. Build a list/detail view for Hinge profiles, of any design of your choosing.
2. Add the ability to edit user profiles.
3. Add authentication.
4. Add the ability to add, edit, remove questions.
5. Add any feature of your choosing.
